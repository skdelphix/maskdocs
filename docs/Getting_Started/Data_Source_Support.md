# Masking Data Source Support

The Delphix Masking service supports profiling, masking, and tokenizing
a variety of different data sources including distributed databases,
mainframe, PaaS databases, and files. At a high level, Delphix Masking
breaks up support for data sources into two categories:

  - **Dedicated Delphix Connectors:** These are data sources that the
    Delphix Engine can connect directly using built-in connectors
    that have been optimized to perform masking, profiling and
    tokenization.

  - **FEML Sources:** FEML (File Extract Mask and Load) is a method
    used to mask, and tokenize data sources that do not have dedicated
    Delphix Connectors. FEML uses existing APIs from data sources to
    extract the data to a file, masks the file, and then uses APIs to
    load the masked file back into the database.

## Dedicated Delphix Connectors

The Delphix Engine has dedicated masking connectors for the following
data sources:

  - **Distributed Database:** DB2 LUW, Oracle, MS SQL, MySQL, SAP ASE
    (Sybase), PostgreSQL, MariaDB

  - **Mainframe:** DB2 Z/OS, DB2 iSeries, VSAM

  - **PaaS Database:** AWS RDS Oracle

  - **Files:** Excel, Fixed Width, Delimited, XML

For a detailed view of all the versions, features, etc Delphix supports
on each data source - see the sections below. For a higher level matrix
please see our [<span class="underline">Data Source support
matrices</span>](https://docs.delphix.com/display/DOCS525/Support+Matrices).

### DB2 LUW Connector
