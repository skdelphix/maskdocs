# Data Source Support

The Delphix Masking service supports profiling, masking, and tokenizing
a variety of different data sources including distributed databases,
mainframe, PaaS databases, and files. At a high level, Delphix Masking
breaks up support for data sources into two categories:

  - **Dedicated Delphix Connectors:** These are data sources that the
    Delphix Engine can connect to directly using built-in connectors
    that have been optimized to perform masking, profiling and
    tokenization.

  - **FEML Sources:** FEML (File Extract Mask and Load) is a method
    used to mask and tokenize data sources that do not have dedicated
    Delphix Connectors. FEML uses existing APIs from data sources to
    extract the data to a file, masks the file, and then uses APIs to
    load the masked file back into the database.

## Dedicated Delphix Connectors

The Delphix Engine has dedicated masking connectors for the following
data sources:

  - **Distributed Database:** DB2 LUW, Oracle, MS SQL, MySQL, SAP ASE
    (Sybase), PostgreSQL, MariaDB

  - **Mainframe/Midrange:** DB2 Z/OS, DB2 iSeries, Mainframe data sets

  - **PaaS Database:** AWS RDS Oracle, RDS PostgreSQL, RDS MYSQL, RDS MariaDB,
    RDS MS SQL Server

  - **Files:** Fixed Width, Delimited, XML

For a detailed view of all the versions, features, etc Delphix supports
on each data source - see the sections below.

### DB2 LUW Connector

#### Introduction

DB2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows is a database server product developed
by IBM. Sometimes
called DB2 LUW for brevity, it is part of the DB2 family of database
products. DB2 LUW is the

### MySQL / MariaDB Connector

#### Introduction

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the Swedish
company MySQL AB. MySQL is now owned by Oracle Corporation.

MariaDB is a community-developed fork of the MySQL relational database
management system intended to remain free under the GNU GPL. Development
is led by some of the original developers of MySQL, who forked it due to
concerns over its acquisition by Oracle Corporation.

A MySQL Connector may be used to connect to either a MySQL or MariaDB
database instance.
