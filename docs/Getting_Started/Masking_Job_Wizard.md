Delphix Maskings Job Wizard  enables users to create and modify masking jobs. 
While the wizard facilitates a number of workflows and operations, more
advanced functionality and a finer control of features is available directly
in the masking application. The Job Wizard currently functions only with certain
data platforms, but these constraints do not apply when working directly in the
masking application.

# Supported Data Platforms
The following data platforms are currently supported from within the Job Wizard:
 - Oracle Database
 - RDS Oracle Database
 - MSSQL Server Database
 - Sybase Database

This restricted list only affects your use of the wizard; an expanded number of
platforms are supported directly in the masking application. Some operations
within the Job Wizard are also limited. See below for details.




# Opening the Masking Job Wizard

or begin masking immediately. To open the Job Wizard, click Run on the welcome
page.
