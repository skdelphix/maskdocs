## Provision a VDB to Prepare to Configure a Masking Job

In order to prepare data for masking, you must first provision a virtual
databases (VDBs) in the Delphix Engine. This database will be used to
configure the masking job. If you would like to test the functionality
of the masking job while preserving the original data in the VDB, you
may provision a second VDB to validate against. To do so, repeat these
steps.

1.  Login to the **Delphix Management** application.

2.  Click **Manage**.

3.  Select **Datasets**.

4.  Select a **dSource**.

5.  Select the **TimeFlow** tab and select a **dSource snapshot**.

6.  Click the **Provision VDB** icon.

7.  Review the information for **Installation Home**, **Database Unique
    Name**, **SID**, and **Database Name**. Edit as necessary.

8.  Review the **Mount Base** and **Environment User**. Edit as
    necessary.

9.  If you want to use login credentials on the target environment that
    are different from the login credentials associated with the
    **Environment User**, select **Specify Privileged Credentials**.

10. Click **Next**.

11. Select a **Target Group** for the VDB and a **Snapshot Policy** for
    the VDB.

12. Click **Next**.

13. Specify any **Pre** or **Post Scripts** that should be used during
    the provisioning process.

14. Click **Advanced** to select Oracle Node Listeners or enter any VDB
    configuration settings or file mappings.
